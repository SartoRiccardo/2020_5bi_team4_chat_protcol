# Project Success Criteria

## Criteria

### A fully functional test system is delivered on or before May 31th
The website shall be ready to use and the users shall be given the training they need in order to begin using the website.
We will consider both of these goals met, if the users who plan to use the website during its test period fill out the attached Acceptance Test User Survey and:

+ No one circles “No” on the first two questions
+ If anyone circles “Yes, with reservations”  these reservations shall be resolved prior to June 8th.

### Concerns raised during the test period are addressed according to the Problem Resolution Plan contained in the Software Project Management Plan
All problems found before June 15th shall be fixed.

The changes will be managed in this way:
+ Changes taking 30 hours or less will take 3 weeks to fix
+ Changes taking 20 hours or less will take 2 weeks to fix
+ Changes taking 10 hours or less will take 1 weeks to fix


### Teachers that are PCTO tutors, students and PCTO managers can easily log into the system with Classe Viva credentials
Each of them shall have different permissions.
PCTO mangers will be able to add new companies, update the ones already stored and remove or authorize a reservation. Students will only be able to see the companies and choose one of them. PCTO tutors will be able to reserve companies for the students.

### The PCTO supervisor can edit the data and reservations
Specifically the PCTO supervisor, after logging in, will be able to update and add new companies to the database and remove or authorize the reservations.

### The PCTO supervisor can create and edit the companies
The PCTO supervisor, after logging in, will be able to update and add new companies to the database.

### The production database is updated
Data from the existing PCTO database shall be uploaded to the new system. Data from all fields in the existing database shall be migrated to corresponding fields in the new database.

### Data on PCTO database is available for download
The PCTO supervisor shall be able to download data from the database through the website as a CSV file.


### The System is properly documented
Firstly, a user manual shall be produced and included. This shall be easily understood by people who don't know the website or the data on the database.
This manual shall explain how to use all features of the website based on the permissions. For example for the PCTO tutors this guide shall explain how a tutor can reserve a company for a student.
Instead for PCTO supervisors this guide shall explain how use the the whole website.

Secondly, a website manual shall be produced. This websites manual shall consist of the architecture documentation where every information about the system is written.
A single read through of this document and no more than 2 hours looking at the code should provide an appropriately skilled technician with all the information necessary to understand the system and make simple changes such as modifying the aesthetic of the website or the database.
