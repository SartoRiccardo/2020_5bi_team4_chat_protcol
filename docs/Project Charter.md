## Finantial Information
The project has no budget, and no employee is getting paid

## Purpose
Everyday people use messages to communicate with other people or share information like photos, videos and documents.
All these opportunities are made possible thanks to network, computer science and protocols.
Students must implement a chat protocol to learn how it works, what could be possible problems and how to solve them.
It gives guys the possibility to write a program that emulate a real chat, based on a protocol and is an opportunity to understand all the aspect of everyday things. 

## Goals and Objectives
The overall goal is to create a sort of system where authorized students can communicate with each other in private or in groups.
The program is expected to:
- Provide a textual or graphical interface to communicate.
-   Send and control packets that respect the protocol.
-   Send and receive messages, view their content and provide general information about the chat, for example who is logged in.
