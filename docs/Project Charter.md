|**Constraints**|The final solution must not depend on a specific programming language (Python and Java are recommended). Both on the server and client side it is advisable to create a graphical interface for better user interaction with the final product.|
| **Assumptions** | Customers through a graphical interface (client) can access a chat with other users through the server. Obviously to connect to the server, the customer must provide a user and password.  |
| **Success Criteria**| The project will be considered a success if a developer delivers a working client or server program.
