##### Purpose
Everyday people use messages to communicate with other people or share information like photos, videos and documents.
All these opportunities are made possible thanks to network, computer science and protocols.
Students must implement a chat protocol to learn how it works, what could be possible problems and how to solve them.
It gives guys the possibility to write a program that emulate a real chat, based on a protocol and is an opportunity to understand all the aspect of everyday things.
