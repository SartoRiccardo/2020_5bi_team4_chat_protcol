# 5BI Team 4 Project Documentation

These documents are made to practice documenting a project. The documents may have contraddicting information, and they might even talk about different projects, but the purpose is to learn how to document properly.

At the bottom of each Markdown document you have the option to see and download it as a PDF file.
