## Effort
### Initiation
| Activities | Actual Effort |
|--|--|
| The project began with interviews with the PCTO tutor for the required needs | 3 hrs |
### Elaboration
| Activities | Actual Effort |
|--|--|
| Creation of documentation regarding a summary of the tutor's requests and to have an ideal overview of the pages that will be made on the site | 8 hrs |
| Design of tables in the database for data entry with Phpmyadmin | 2 hrs |
| Create in python the code for the ETL process, which allows you to take the data from csv and export it correctly in the database | 10 hrs |
| After being given the php part of the Classeviva login, we had to study it to modify it for our application | 1 hrs |
### Construction
| Activities | Actual Effort |
|--|--|
| Construction of the login page from scratch through forms or through an online search for ready-made templates, modifying them with the link to the Classeviva request | 3 hrs |
| Check the login credentials through a request that compares the data provided by the user with the Classeviva database with all accounts | 1 hrs |
| Construction of the user page with the possibility of displaying the companies through a filter table with an extra page with all the information of the company once you press on it | 10 hrs |
| Construction of the tutor page with the possibility to modify, create and delete the parameters of a row with an editable table | 10 hrs |
| Construction of a company information page through a parameter passed from the user page where each company will be a link that leads precisely to this page | 5 hrs |
### Conclusion
| Activities | Actual Effort | 
|--|--|
| Have user control to understand if it is a common user who wants to log in or a tutor. The modified code will be that of the request which, through an array, checks whether it is a student or a teacher | 30 mnt |
