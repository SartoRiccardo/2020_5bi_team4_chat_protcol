# Success Criteria for PCTO Project

#### The PCTO project will be considered a success if . . .

##### A fully functional test system is delivered on or before May 31th.
The site web shall be delivered in a state that is ready to be used in its intended production environment for its intended purpose. The users shall be given the training they need in order to begin using the site web. We will consider both of these goals met if the users who plan to use the system during its test period fill out the attached Acceptance Test User Survey and:
*	No one circles “No” on the first two questions
*	If anyone circles “Yes, with reservations” on the first two questions, these reservations shall be resolved prior to June 8th to the satisfaction of the users with the reservations

##### Concerns raised during the test period are addressed according to the problem resolution plan contained in the Software Project Management Plan
All critical defects found before June 15th will be fixed. A critical defect is one for which there is no convenient workaround. Beyond fixing defects, requested changes will be handled on a sliding scale. Changes taking 30 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 3 weeks before the scheduled end of the project. Changes taking 20 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 2 weeks before the scheduled end of the project.

Changes taking 10 hours or less will be done if notified of the change 1 week before the scheduled end of the project.
Users shall be notified of their rights and responsibilities under this policy prior to the start of acceptance test.
