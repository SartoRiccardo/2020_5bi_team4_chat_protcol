# MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING FOR PCTO

**1. Purpose**

The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is to serve as a written understanding between Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Agency team 4th.  This MOU documents the responsibilities of the principal organizations involved in the deployment of System Name being deployed.

**2. Objectives, Scope, and Major Activities**
  * **Objectives:** The objective of System being deployed is to provide integrated automation of the list system function(s) and who will use the system.  System being deployed will provide for “login” information to be made accessible to alumns and teachers within the School.

  * **Scope:** The scope of PCTO is to support provide brief statement of data about companies where the students can go to do the PCTO experience. Students thank to this application can easily find the perfect compnies for their.  

  * **Major Activities:** The major activities of this system will be to manage PCTO in accordance with team 4th, FCC Computer Security Program Directive, FCC Instruction 1479.2 and other relevant FCC guidance.  The FCC system custodian will ensure that the system, designing and engineering concept, architectural and interface baselines and interoperability at all levels is consistent with FCC policies, including the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and change management processes.

**3. Responsibilities**
  * **Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Program/Custodian Office**

  As the principal FCC representative for the PCTO functional area, the team 4th is the proponent for the System being deployed and is ultimately responsible for review and validation of the system documentation and proposed system modifications.  In addition, the team 4th will:

  1.	Seek support for, program for, budget, and provide the funding necessary for successful integration of the system, including all necessary information assurance, data and computer security requirements;
  2.	Ensure that appropriate ITC program managers and the Customer Service Representative are kept appraised of any planned or proposed system modifications so that adequate time for consideration can be offered to the system;
  3.	Ensure that required strategic functional plan for system name are developed;
  4.	Provide all required information pertaining to the system, its characteristics and configuration to allow FCC personnel to classify the system as required by OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III and other Federal mandates;
  5.	Ensure compliance with all applicable Federal mandates with regard to computer-based system usage; and
  6.	Sign this agreement and act in the best interest of the FCC to ensure continued availability and integrity of PCTO and associated data.

  * **MOU ITI G. Marconi**

  The MOU ITI G. Marconi, will provide all necessary computer based services to the FCC, team 4th to ensure successfully deployment of PCTO.  In addition the MOU Federal Agency will:

  1.	Provide strategic guidance and oversight to FCC, team 4th on the secure and adequate implementation of PCTO;
  2.	Ensure that baseline agreements on system availability, reliability and accessibility are met or otherwise highlighted and discussed with the FCC, team 4th;
  3.	Define/redefine requirements and push solutions/capabilities to the FCC as quickly as possible;
  4.	Ensure system alternatives and solutions will be supportable and usable by FCC users;
  5.	Perform the systems engineering, test, configuration management, and total integration effort in concert with FCC points of contact.  Define the system architecture, interfaces and develop support concepts for the FCC system(s);
  6.	Work with the other signatories of this MOU to ensure total program involvement and understanding is reached and to ensure the program is executed in a successful manner and the goals are met;
  7.	Exercise the functional responsibility for the management of PCTO, reporting to the FCC point of contact on all issues concerning integration of processes and data in the system; and
  8.	Monitor execution of the services provided by PCTO, including the infrastructure efforts required ensuring continued availability.

**4. Services**
	All services provided under this MOU shall be highlighted in this section, including but not limited to:

  * Description of the information system architecture;
  *	Description of communication links;
  *	Description of system specific algorithms to be implemented;
  *	Advanced notification of any planned system modifications, including client modifications;
  *	Testing that will be done internally at both ends of the interface;
  *	Support and resource required by both the FCC and the management agency;
  *	System availability schedule (e.g., 24/7, 8/5, etc.);
  *	System reliability plans;
  *	System security (e.g., data being transmitted across the system will be encrypted at “x” bit, etc.);
  *	Data/system backed-up schedule;
  *	Contingency and Disaster Recovery plans will adequately document system/data recovery efforts;
  *	System security plan(s), if applicable;
  *	Systems risk analysis, computer security certification and accreditation, and security test and evaluation overview, if applicable.
