# Iteration Plan

## Objectives


The iteration in this application allows the user to have a visualization of the companies proposed by the school for school-work alternation. The basic user, therefore parent or pupil, will have the opportunity to view the companies with a filter table via school address and municipality of residence. Instead, the tutor can modify the table by adding or deleting rows.  There will be no registration, the access will be performed with the credentials of the electronic register, therefore there will be two types of access managed: one for the basic user and one for the tutor teacher


## Use Cases

As previously mentioned, there are two users, one is the basic user who can interact with the table by scroll down with the selection of the address and the municipality to which the basic user belongs; there is also an input field where you can search for the company name. The second user, on the other hand, will be able not only to do the things of the first user, but also to add companies or remove or make changes to the fields of a specific company

## Task Schedule

 -   As a first point, you need to create a form with html that allows the input field
 -   Next you need to send the information given in the form on a php page that processes it with the Classeviva algorithm and see if the user is a student or a teacher or tutor
- Once the records have been processed, the user will be directed to his page depending on what type of user he is and here he can start interacting with the page
