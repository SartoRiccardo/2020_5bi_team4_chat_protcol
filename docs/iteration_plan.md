# Iteration Plan

## Objectives

The purpose of this iteration is to allow ordinary users, such as parents and students of ITIS G. Marconi, to more easily find the most appropriate companies for the students who must complete their internship. At the end of the iteration, an user must be able to:

 - After logging in, through a filter table, perform a search according to their school address and according to their country of residence, to find a company convenient to their needs
    - The table will allow the selection of the company in question which will open a page where the information of that specific company will be displayed. Then you can have an address and the number of the company to be able to contact it and ask information about it
## Use Cases

There will be two types of users who can access this application with two different interfaces. The use cases of this iteration are:

 - **Use Case 1:** A tutor logs in — The tutor interface is an editable interface, in fact the tutor will be able to add companies and even delete them if they are no longer affiliated with the school
 - **Use Case 2:** A student logs in — Common users can choose the company and then notify the school tutors of the choice made
